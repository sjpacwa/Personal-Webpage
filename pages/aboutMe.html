			<h2>About Me.</h2>
			<div>
				<p>I am a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University located in California. Currently, I am expected to graduate with a B.S. in 2019. I am always looking to improve my skills and learning new things about my wide variety of computer-related interests. These include new languages to add to my growing knowledge base (C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS), as well as new programming practices to increase run-time efficiency. I enjoy playing computer games, and my love of programming has allowed me to start exploring modifications of certain games. Overall, I feel that as a motivated individual, I am going to be able to do a lot with my degree as well as influence the lives of many people.
