	<h1>Stephen Pacwa</h1>
	<h2>This is a test page for my new style.</h2>
	<h3>General Goals</h3>
	<p>There were a wide variety of general goals that I set out to acheive with this new CSS style. One of them was to make the appearance of my website not only pleasing on the eyes, but something that could be recognized easily. Furthermore, I wanted something that I could modify easily while still keeping the general feel and look. Because of this there were a large variety of choices that were made in order to create a form of standardization. Something that I wanted to get across in the design of my webpage was a certain level of minimalism. Because of this the use of serif fonts is limited and the page itself offers no serious distractions. This allows a high level of focus to be given to the message of the text itself. Once downside of a minimalistic deisgn is that it may appear simple to create and does not garner the respect that some websites have such as <a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/10series/geforce-gtx-1080">Nvidia</a> and instead causes it to have more in common with <a href="http://www.amistech.com/msc/">My Summer Car</a>. </p>
	<h3>Additional Advantages</h3>
	<p>There are a wide variety of additional advantages from modifying the CSS of a website to get it to look a certain way. Now I want to show off how certain code will look when inserted into the page. </p>
	<pre>
    <code>
      //Here is some preformatted C++ code.
      //It returns a double average of an array.

      double average(double[] input) {
          double total = 0;
          for(int i = 0; i = input.length; ++i) {
              total += input[i];
          }

          return total / input.length;
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>This should look relatively nice in the page and fit in between the two lines of text without causing problems. Another thing that should be included and made sure to work properly is images which I will include here cause that is where it goes, let's get some more filler text here and see how this looks here and here and test, one two, two, three, test, test. "Ok the microphones work" Stephen shouted to his coworker, "Time to get the rest of this setup finished." He was not a very happy person and when he got home all he wanted to do was go to bed. Where were we, oh yes pictures. Here is a nice picture of Santa Clara Mission:</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>In conclusion I would like to thank Tommy Wiseau for inspiring me to work on this webpage, as well as his beautiful wife for showing me the path to take through her wonderfully successful IT consultation business (If that is really what she did, other than Mark). </p>
