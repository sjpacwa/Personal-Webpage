		<h2>The Eight Queens Problem.</h2>
		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>
		The Eight Queens problem was initially proposed in 1848 by a chess composer Max Bezzel. Simply put, the aim of the puzzle is to place eight queens on an eight-by-eight chessboard such that no two queens share a similar line of sight. in other words, they are not located on the same horizontal, vertical, or diagonal axis. The first solution to this problem was presented two years later by Franz Nauck in 1850. Afterwards, a generalized form of the problem was created, the <var>n</var>-queens version. This one is similar except there are <var>n</var> queens, on an <var>n</var>-by-<var>n</var> chess board. Solutions exist for all versions excluding the two- and three-queens versions. I thought that solving this problem algorithmically would be a fun, informative, and interesting challenge.

		<h3>Initial Information</h3>
		<p>
		It is initially obvious that a brute force solution of the problem will take an incredible amount of time and effort. This is made even more obvious when the problem is generalized. Several observations can be made in order to generate a more efficient solution. If the chessboard is placed so that it is being looked at top down, the algorithm will start at the top left, and will continue downwards and to the right. Because only one queen will be placed in each row, these lines of sight do not need to be kept track of. Furthermore, when a queen is placed, the column that it is placed in will never hold a queen. Therefore, this information can be stored and checked, instead of filling all boxes vertically with markers. Because of this, the only information that should be stored in an 2-D array is the location of the queens that have been placed and their diagonal lines of sight.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is another consideration that is not as easily recognizable as the first. If queens are continually placed on the board, the possibility exists that a solution will never be found. For example, once a certain number of queens are placed a certain way, it is possible that there are no more valid locations and eight queens are never placed. The best way to deal with these situations in computer science is to take advantage of recursion. This will allow us to advance to a certain point and, once it has been determined that it is a failure, to revert to a previous position and try another queens' position. This will continue backwards and forwards until a correct solution has been determined.

		Bearing in mind this information, conquering the eight queens problem does not seem as incredibly difficult as it once was. Along with the power of computation, a solution can hopefully be determined in less than two years!
